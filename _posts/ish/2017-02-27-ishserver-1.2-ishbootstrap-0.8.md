Lately, the [ISHServer](https://github.com/Sarafian/ISHServer) and [ISHBootstrap](https://github.com/Sarafian/ISHBootstrap) are being constantly improve with new features and fixing some bugs that we find. The automation has matured enough and we are now focusing on using this automation to build AWS EC2 AMIs, Docker containers and maybe even Packer files.  
 
There is still progress to be made but there is already a working prototype code with the ability to create an AWS EC2 AMI and then spin up an instance. 
 
In the meanwhile, I would like to share with everyone the availability of new versions for ISHServer and ISHBootstrap. 
 
## ISHServer v1.2 
 
[ISHServer](https://github.com/Sarafian/ISHServer) is PowerShell module that automates the preparation of a clean Windows Server operating system for a SDL Knowledge Center Content Manager deployment. 
 
Currently only,[ISHServer.12](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ISHServer.12/),is available in the PowerShell gallery to align with SDL Knowledge Center 2016 releases for Content Manager., 
 
Enhancements and fixes in the new version [1.2](https://github.com/Sarafian/ISHServer/releases/tag/v1.2) are: 
 
- Support for Azure File and Blog storage for,the files it depends on. That is for the cmdlets that download the Prerequisites, the CD and the AntennaHouse license. The functionality was already present for FTP sources. 
- Small bug fixes. 
 
## ISHBootstrap v0.8 
 
[ISHBootstrap](https://github.com/Sarafian/ISHBootstrap),offers the tooling,for an end to end SDL Knowledge Center deployment. It depends on **ISHServer** but it does so much more. 
 
Enhancements and fixes in the new version [1.3](https://github.com/Sarafian/ISHBootstrap/releases/tag/v0.8) are: 
 
- Support for Azure File and Blog storage to follow up with the [ISHServer v1.2](https://github.com/Sarafian/ISHServer/releases/tag/v1.2) release. 
- Small bug fixes. 
 
## ISHBootstrapDemo 
 
If you want to do a quick demo dry run then take a look at the,[ISHBootstrapDemo](https://github.com/Sarafian/ISHBootstrapDemo). I created this repository just before the [SDL Connect](http://www.sdl.com/event/sdl-connect/palo-alto/) to showcase how easy it is to fully bootstrap an empty Operating System. The repository has an embedded,[JSON](https://github.com/Sarafian/ISHBootstrapDemo/blob/master/ISHBootstrap.json) file that shows has simple it is. Please take notice that the example is based on SDL's ftp and you will need to provide you ftp credential. Also, there is an expected structure on the FTP server that is not currently available for all FTP accounts. Please ask your support engineer to make the necessary artifacts available for your account also.
